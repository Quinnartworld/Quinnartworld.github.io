					Welcome to the most refined gallery of any artist ever. <br>
					now I, the curator, could just show you some of Quinn's <br>
					great art, but i'd like to be at least a bit transformative. <br>
					So I will be presenting this art in forms from other galaxies

					waht else  is there to say? two lesbians of different races in <br>
					loving embraces online, surely their esex will go nicely. I bet <br>
					they will have many children... and then be HOMESTUCK for ever!
